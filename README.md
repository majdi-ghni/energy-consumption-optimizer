## Introduction:

The Energy Consumption Optimizer is a web application developed as part of a bachelor's thesis project at TH LÃ¼beck, in collaboration with adesso company. This tool is designed to empower consumers by optimizing the operation timing of household appliances based on dynamic electricity pricing. By leveraging real-time electricity price predictions from the energy spot market, the app provides both financial and ecological benefits to users.
